        <h1>Stockx - the revolution in the sneakers world</h1>
        <p>Stock X's best selling brands range from Adidas and Nike for sneakers, to KAWS and bearbrick for streetwear, to Rolex and Apple for watches. Their products are sold through a bidding process where sellers would set the price they are willing to sell the products for - called an 'ask' - and the buyers would bid until both sides reach an agreement, in which transaction would automatically be made. To ensure product quality, after setting their ask, sellers must send their products to StockX's team of authenticators. The authenticators are based in New York and London. Although sellers can set the initial bid price, buyers have access to the average final price for the same products, based on past bid wins on the site.</p>
